      <p>Hey folks, I'm @jomrcr.</p>

      <p>I study <b class="aqua">mathematics</b> in the co-op program at the University of Waterloo, and in the off terms I intern at tech companies.</p>

      <p>This term I've declared my major for <b class="red">Combinatorics and Optimization</b>, which means I'm taking a bunch of CO classes.</p>

      <p>Last Winter I was interning as a PM @ Microsoft in Seattle, which is also where I grew up. I was helping build the Activity Feed on <b class="indigo">Xbox Live</b>, and it was a lot of fun experiencing the process from the PM perspective. One of the things that surprised me the most was how much alignment happens behind the scenes. I was working with <b class="amber">designers and developers</b>, but at the scale of Microsoft I was also working behind the scenes to align with legal, security, privacy, advertising teams.</p>

      <p>In the Fall I was studying abroad in Hong Kong at HKUST. It was an exciting time to be there; I participated in the #UmbrellaRevolution. And <b class="orange">Hong Kong</b> is absolutely gorgeous. And milk tea and dim sum. I was also taking Pure Math courses, in Number Theory and Geometry.</p>

      <p>The term before that I was doing a Software Engineering internship @ <b class="blue">Noom</b>, a mobile startup in NYC. Living in the city was crazy. I was in SoHo and in the East Village, and I was working in Chelsea. All the eating. Working at a mobile company was interesting, but I think my pre-biases hold. I'm a web guy. My favorite part about Noom was getting to participate in the Design process, and interact closely with the users. I also got to do some UX research type stuff.</p>

      <p>My fifth school term I was in Mathematics, but unsure which direction to take. So I did a little bit of everything: Pure Math, Combinatorics, Optimization, Statistics, Computer Science (Logic), and Applied Math (Calculus).</p>

      <p>For my second internship I was on the web team @ Tagged in SF.</p>

      <p>I'm surprisingly good at pool.</p>

      <p>For my fourth school term I switched from Management Engineering to Mathematics, with the intent of majoring in CS. I took all the CS courses I could, but ended up liking them as much as I was expecting. I was also taking the Advanced Version of Linear Algebra 2, which was crazy hard.</p>

      <p>For my first internship I was working @ Bazaarvoice in Austin. Working with clutch team of JavaScript developers: Alex Sexton, Rebecca Murphy. This is probably why I'm a web guy now.</p>

      <p>For my first three terms I was in Management Engineering. I kind of killed it. Top of my class.</p>

      <p>I was born and raised in Redmond, which is a suburb of Seattle. In High School I played varsity basketball. I also worked as a lifeguard and coach at the local pool.</p>
